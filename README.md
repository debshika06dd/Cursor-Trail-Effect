# 🎨 Custom Cursor Trail Effect

This project creates a smooth and interactive custom cursor with a trailing animation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When the user moves the mouse, a main cursor circle follows instantly, and multiple smaller circles follow behind with a delay — creating a glowing trail effect.
